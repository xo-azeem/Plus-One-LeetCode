LeetCode Q # 66.

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.
Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

Example 1:

Input: digits = [1,2,3]</br>
Output: [1,2,4]</br>
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].

Example 2:

Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]</br>
Output: [4,3,2,2]</br>
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
